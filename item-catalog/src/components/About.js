            A product catalog is a type of marketing collateral that lists
            essential product details that help buyers make a purchase decision.
            These details include product features, descriptions, dimensions,
            price, weight, availability, color, customer reviews, and more.
            Product catalogs are useful to several business users and groups
            such as sales reps, inside sales, buyers, store clerks, field
            marketers, and managers.
